Amplifier Configuration

circuit -1

Aim:

To perform the DC, Transient, AC Analysis of a Common Source amplifier circuit using LTSpice and extract the associated parameters.

Components Required:

TSMC 180nm NMOS transistor (CMOSN), PMOS transistor (CMOSP),source resistor and voltage sources(3)

Circuit diagram:

given parameters:
Vov=0.25v,Vth=0.36,VDD=1.2,P<=0.4mw ,L=180nm

Procedure

1.Design the CS amplifier as per the circuit diagram using LTSpice.

2.Set the components values as per the given parameters.

3.Create a new folder and save the LTSpice file in this folder along with the library file

4.Calculate the current value for the given power=0.4mw

Dc Analysis:

DC Analysis is done to check if the MOSFET is operating in the saturation region and to obtain the DC operation point.

procedure:
1.After setting up the circuit as per the circuit diagram, apply the dc voltage VDD=1.2V and Vgs=0.61
2.Go to Simultae option in the tab and the DC opt option and click 'ok'.
3.Click on run to run the circuit.
4.DC operating point is obtained.
